Unier, a live speech-to-text and text-to-speech app, designed to make communication seamless for the deaf and mute communities. With Unier, we're creating a tool that empowers users to engage in real-time conversations with others without needing an intermediary, opening up a world of possibilities!
Inspired by the functionality of Nagish, A real-time text to speech and speech to text conversion application that let's deaf and  dumb people to converse with each other over a normal sim call.
